# Daily Log

## Friday 4th:

I start the project without any mockUp or whatever, because I've been having problems with CORS policy
in my browser, so I have a big delay with my partners.


## Monday 7th:

First of all, without any HTML writed, I raise myself to find a solution to correctly call all fetch.

I have been working with html and bootstrap in css to do the minimum visible page.

And manually drawing a pre-mockUp of the page and writing this daily log.

## Tuesday 8th:

I have problems with GIT just because of all re-installation of vscode, node, etc. So I have to install and configure it.

Some new interface added and configure bootstrap to opening modals.

## Wednesday 9th:

Listed all interfaces in only one TS document, I think that is useless to have a document to each interface with aprox 9 lines... Added function to pagination these interfaces.

Some modification of CSS.

## Thursday 10th:

I can't find a solution to fetch episodes name inside characters card. I spend my time to put some buttons of pagination to load more Chars, Locations and Episodes. I don't feel confident with my project and unable to emprove it.

## Friday 11th:

I tried to fetch characters->episodes url and episodes->characters

Working on this daily log, README document and writing a script of how i'll going to explain the project.
